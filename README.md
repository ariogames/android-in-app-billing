WHAT IS THIS SAMPLE?
--------------------

   This game is a simple "driving" game where the player can buy gas
   and drive. The car has a tank which stores gas. When the player purchases
   gas, the tank fills up (1/4 tank at a time). When the player drives, the gas
   in the tank diminishes (also 1/4 tank at a time).

   The user can also purchase a "premium upgrade" that gives them a red car
   instead of the standard blue one (exciting!).

   The user can also purchase a subscription ("infinite gas") that allows them
   to drive without using up any gas while that subscription is active.
